Some More C++ Basics
	Finish Chapter 2
	First Homework is assigned (Due Tuesday 20170905)
	
	Agenda
		Flow of Control
		Program Style

	Flow of Control
		Different actions based on input
		Demo
			if (BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION)
				[Statement]
			else
				[Statement]
		Else is not required
		Compound Statements
		{
		}
		Treated as single statment

		while loop
				while (BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION)
					{
					[Statement(s)]
					}	
			Boolean expression evaluated
			if true brackets executed
			repeats till false
		do while loop
				do {
					[Statement(s)]
				} while(boolean_expression);
	Style
		Mean by style
			How it looks
		Hard to read already
			That of other people
			Your own code later that day
			Write code that can be understood
		Generally Universal Standerds

		Whitespace
			Compilers don't care
			We do
				Proper identation
				Seperatiing code into logical groups
				Proper Indentation is part of homework grade
		Comments
			Properly done makes easier to understand
			Overly verbose/frequent
				Harder to read
			Requirements lean toward a higher freq of comments
				Show understanding of what you wrote
				Blocks should have discriptive comment
		Naming
			Very long/easy way to making code understandable
			Variable names should be descriptive object names
			Function name should have an action word
			Choosing good names can be harder than it seems
		Constants
			Need to work w/ specific numbers sometimes
			To avoid confusion we can name the number
				All Caps ie (NUM_BRANCHES)
		Consistency
			Naming
			Indentation
			Brace Placement
