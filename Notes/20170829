Some C++ Basics
	Variables
		Programs Way of Naming/Storing
		Data in Varaiable is the value
		Variables ALWAYS have a value
		Variables stored in memory
	
		How Do We Name Variables
			Must Start with Letter or "_"
			How Should we name variables?
				Constistent Naming Scheme
				Be Descriptive and Succinct
		Variables start with lowercase
	
		C++ is Case Sensitive
		Variable Declaration
			Must be declared
				Specific Way
					<TYPE> <NAME> [= INITIAL VALUE];
					int numBoxes;
					int numBoxes = 0;
					double meanBoxes;
		Variable Types
			Integer -> Int
				int one, two = 2, three;
			Double-precision floating point -> double
				15 Decimal Points
			Character -> char
				single characters only single quotes needed
					char boxType = 'c';
				Also interpreted as small integers
					'A' == 65
					'a' == 97
			Boolean -> bool
				Holds one of 2 values (1 or 0)
			Strings -> strings
				Not a native data type
				Implemented as a class
				Discussed later
	Input and Output
		Input/Output are carreid to and from the program in streams
		For Now
			Input = Keyboard
			Output = Screen
		Output w/ cout
			see Hello_World files
			<< is the insertion operator
		Special characters
			Start w/ \
				\n new
				\t horizontal tab
				\\ backslash
				\" double quote
					cout << "\" Call me Ishmael.\""
