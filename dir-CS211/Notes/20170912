Agenda:
	Chapter 4
	Top Down Design
	Predefined Functions
	Programmer Defined Functions

Top Down Design
	First Step?
	Psuedocode?
	Called an algorithm

Plan Of Attack
	Break down into smaller sub-tasks
	Break down further [sub-]sub-tasks
	Continue until trivial to do
	This is Top Down

Benefits of Top Down
	Easier	to understand
			to change
			to write
			to test
			to debug
	cpp called functions

Predefined Functions
	cpp comes with libaries of pre-def functions
	double sqrt(x) is a function
	
What's Required
	type of return value?
	what libary is required?
	What are the arguments?
	namespace?

How to find
	Source Code
	cplusplus.com

Type Casting
	Two Types
		Implicit
		Explicit
	Implicit
		Done for you by Compiler
	Explicit
		Can tell a var to assume the role of another type
		static_cast<NEW.TYPE>(ARGUMENT)
	
Programmer Defined Functions
	Where to put them?
	Must be known before called or used
	Place entire func in main() or declare ahead of main()

	What is Required
		data type of value returned
		name
		section for our parameters
	
Functions
	Small Programs
	Only know what theey are given
	only way to give outside knowledge is through parameters
	Strict
	Proper makes Modular
